Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning-based Credit Card Fraud Detection system capable of identifying and classifying fraudulent financial transactions. Since most real-world credit card datasets are highly imbalanced with very few fraud cases compared to normal ones, this project includes techniques like data preprocessing, normalization, and class balancing using methods such as SMOTE and undersampling. 
Various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Isolation Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks are trained and compared to identify the most accurate model for fraud prediction. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC because detecting fraud requires minimizing false negatives while maintaining good overall accuracy.
The final results show that ensemble models and anomaly detection-based techniques provide higher reliability in detecting suspicious patterns.
This project demonstrates how machine learning can support secure financial transactions and can be extended further by deploying it using Flask/Streamlit, integrating explainable AI techniques, and adapting the model for real-time fraud monitoring.
